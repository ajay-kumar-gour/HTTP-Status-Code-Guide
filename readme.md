# Welcome to HTTP-Status-Code-Guide

This repository provides a comprehensive list of HTTP status codes along with their categories and descriptions.

# HTTP Status Code Definitions

HTTP status codes are standard response codes given by web servers on the internet. They communicate the status of the HTTP request made by a client, such as a web browser or an API consumer. These status codes are three-digit numbers grouped into different categories, each representing a specific outcome of the request-response cycle. They provide valuable information about whether a request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action.

# Types of status codes

|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1xx   | Informational: The server has received the request and is continuing the process. |
| 2xx   | Success: The request was received, understood, and accepted by the server. |
| 3xx   | Redirection: Further action needs to be taken to complete the request. |
| 4xx   | Client Error: There was an error on the client side. |
| 5xx   | Server Error: The server encountered an error while processing the request. |
