# HTTP Status Code Definitions

HTTP status codes are standard response codes given by web servers on the internet. They communicate the status of the HTTP request made by a client, such as a web browser or an API consumer. These status codes are three-digit numbers grouped into different categories, each representing a specific outcome of the request-response cycle. They provide valuable information about whether a request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action.
